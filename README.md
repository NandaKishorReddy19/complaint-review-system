# complaint-review-system
Here, We have a CMS which works on XAMPP server with SQL database(internally present in XAMPP) we have used PHP,JavaScript,HTML,CSS in order to built this system. Beginning with 'login authentication' to 'Filing and viewing a complaint'. Host and Server present on same system. Can be modified to multiple by making the database central and using APIs. NOTE: NO APIs are used, Simple and Easy.

First of all you should have cms database, For sure you need to have tables named:(for this project,i havent used i after f in verif 'i' cation) adminverifcation(aloginid1,apassword1) studentverifcation(sloginid1,spassword1) complaints(ID,subject,description,created_at,status)

use some default data for autentication as: adminverifcation

| aloginid1 | apassword1 | || | | admin123 | 12345678 | ||_|

studentverifcation

| sloginid1 | spassword1 | || | | student23 | 12345678 | ||_|
